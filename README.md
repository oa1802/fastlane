<h1>FastLane Bike Share</h1>

<p>Wireframe design for a bike share mobile application called FastLane designed in Balsamiq.</p>
  
<p>The goal was to create the main flow of this application from opening the app to rent a bike to completing the ride. One aim was to make this flow as simple as possible as sometimes people can be seen struggling when trying to rent a bike due to a complex user experience or other technical issues.</p>

<p>The design includes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the app.</li>
  <li>Select to rent a bike.</li>
  <li>Scan the QR code on the bike or manually enter the code.</li>
  <li>See the cost of the ride and confirm that you agree to the cost.</li>
  <li>Confirmation that you have rented the bike.</li>
  <li>Once you have finished riding, click finish in the app.</li>
  <li>Confirmation that the ride is finished.</li>
</ol>
